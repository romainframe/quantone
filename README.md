## Overview

QUANTONE is an open-source initiative that bridges the gap between musical expression and mathematical precision. We believe that music is fundamentally mathematical, and mathematics is inherently musical. Our mission is to make these connections visible, tangible, and accessible to everyone—from musicians to mathematicians, from students to researchers.

## 🎵 Features

- **Interactive Rhythm Explorer**: Discover and experiment with various rhythms and their mathematical foundations
- **Mathematical Visualizations**: See the geometric and algebraic patterns underlying musical structures
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English, Spanish, and French
- **Educational Resources**: Access curated literature and research papers on mathematical music theory

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Internationalization**: next-intl
- **Deployment**: Netlify
